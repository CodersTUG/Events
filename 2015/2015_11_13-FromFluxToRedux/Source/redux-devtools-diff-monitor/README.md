# Redux DevTools â€“ Diff Monitor

(3.0 builds with react 0.14 and redux 3.0 in the /src and /examples)

This project provides an alternate monitor for Redux DevTools. The primary goal of this monitor is to highlight the changes to an application's state from action to action. This tool includes the main features from the default DevTools monitor (rollback, commit, reset and individual action toggles).

As with the Redux DevTools, this project is a developer tool and is not intended for use in production.

### Installation Example

Install from npm:

`npm install --save-dev redux-devtools-diff-monitor`

Render Devtools and pass this monitor as a prop, e.g. `<DevTools store={store} monitor={DiffMonitor} />`.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import TodoApp from './TodoApp';
import { createStore, combineReducers, compose } from 'redux';
import { devTools, persistState } from 'redux-devtools';
import { DevTools, DebugPanel, LogMonitor } from 'redux-devtools/lib/react';
import DiffMonitor from 'redux-devtools-diff-monitor';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import * as reducers from '../reducers';

const finalCreateStore = compose(
  devTools(),
  persistState(window.location.href.match(/[?&]debug_session=([^&]+)\b/))
)(createStore);

const reducer = combineReducers(reducers);
const store = finalCreateStore(reducer);

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('../reducers', () =>
    store.replaceReducer(combineReducers(require('../reducers')))
  );
}

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Provider store={store}>
          <TodoApp />
        </Provider>
        <DevTools store={store} monitor={DiffMonitor} shortcut='ctrl+d'/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Usage

- When included as a DevTools monitor, use `Ctrl+]` or `Ctrl+H` to toggle visibility of the frame.
- New actions appear at the top of the monitor as they occur.
- Actions will be minimized by default; actions shown in green are causing a state mutation.
- Click an action name to expand its pane to view the state mutations the action caused.
- Click "disable" next to any action name to ignore that action and roll back the state mutations that action caused.
- As in the default Redux DevTools, click 'Commit' to reset the monitor and set the current app state as the rollback point. If you click rollback after clicking commit, actions will be replayed through the commit point.

### [Example](http://production.diff-monitor-example.divshot.io/)

The TodoMVC example from the Redux Devtools project is included in `./examples/todomvc`. To build and view locally:

1. Run `npm install` from the project root
2. cd to `./examples/todomvc`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` to run the app on port 3000 at localhost.
